        I am a king because I know how to govern myself.People say nothing is
        impossible, but I do nothing every day.I am so clever that sometimes I
        dont understand a single word of what I am saying.I am enough of an
        artist to draw freely upon my imagination.

        If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be bad at following
        directions.I give myself sometimes admirable advice, but I am incapable
        of taking it.Some days, I amaze myself. Other days, I put my keys in the
        fridge.I try to avoid things that make me fat, like scales, mirrors, and
        photographs.

        I am a hard-working and driven individual who isn't afraid to face a
        challenge. I'm passionate about my work and I know how to get the job
        done. I would describe myself as an open and honest person who doesn't
        believe in misleading other people and tries to be fair in everything I
        do.
