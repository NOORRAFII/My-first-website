        dont understand a single word of what I am saying.I am enough of an
        artist to draw freely upon my imagination.

        If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be bad at following
        directions.I give myself sometimes admirable advice, but I am incapable
        of taking it.Some days, I amaze myself. Other days, I put my keys in the
        fridge.I try to avoid things that make me fat, like scales, mirrors, and
        photographs.
